This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, do NPM install :

```
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

The main page will show you all of the available products list that is available inside the JSON data (src/assets/products.json)

Go click one of those products and it will redirect you to the Product Details Page.


## Additional Features

I have also created a login feature, 

Go to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) and input the email and password. 

The correct emails and passwords are : 

```
email1@gmail.com
123abc
```

```
email2@gmail.com
123abc
```

If success, you should be redirected to the main page.
